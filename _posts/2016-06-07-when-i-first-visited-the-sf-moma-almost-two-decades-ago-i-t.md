  Over the years, the SF MOMA did grow on me. I came to love the rooftop garden
  and their lovely Paul Klee pieces. The curators did a great job with the
  special exhibits of Richard Avedon, Louise Bourgeois and Gertrude Stein’s
  collection of Picasso.

  When I first visited the SF MOMA almost two decades ago, I thought that it was

### When I first visited the SF MOMA almost two decades ago, I thought that it was provincial. Having grown up in Los Angles with access to the collections of LACMA and the Getty, I was underwhelmed by SF MOMA's collection and the building that housed it.

Over the years, the SF MOMA did grow on me. I came to love the rooftop garden and their lovely Paul Klee pieces. The curators did a great job with the special exhibits of Richard Avedon, Louise Bourgeois and Gertrude Stein's collection of Picasso.

When the museum received the Fisher Collection, I was as pleased as anyone. When a selection of their pieces were displayed in the museum, I realized what you could do if you had incredible taste and incredible financial resources. But the museum could not show off the true extent of the collection which included Gerhard Richter, Richard Diebenkorn and Agnes Martin because of the space.

Well with the 2+ years of renovation complete, I feel the SF MOMA is now a world class museum. I would happily include it any conversation with Guggenheim, MACBA and Pompidou. If an out of towner should as what they should see in San Francisco, I would not hesitate to send them to SF MOMA. It's worth it!
