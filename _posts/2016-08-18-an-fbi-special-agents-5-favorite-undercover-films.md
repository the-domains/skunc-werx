  I recently had the pleasure of helping writer-director Daniel Ragussis craft
  the story for a new film called Imperium, starring Daniel Radcliffe as an FBI
  undercover agent sent to infiltrate white supremacist groups. I had worked
  undercover in extremist groups during a 16-year FBI career, written a book
  called Thinking Like a Terrorist, and worked on counterterrorism policy as a
  researcher and civil rights lobbyist.
