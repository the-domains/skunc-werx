  In this space, Heart Roasters has been a favorite of mine. For the past 2
  years, I have been drinking coffee from Heart at least 2 to 3 times a week.
  They produce consistently beautiful aromatic and high quality beans. Their
  Ethiopia Idido and Kenya Chorongi have been stand-out. These two can go head
  to head against any coffee in the world.

  Third wave coffee was ushered in by Blue Bottle and Stumptown. Theyâ€™re still
  juggernauts but there is room for small roasters to make their mark.
